# Choreo VS Code extension version 1.0

We are excited to announce the Choreo VS Code extension version 1.0 release, which has a range of features that make it easier and more convenientfoer you to design, develop, and manage cloud-native applications on the Choreo platform.

One of the key features of this release is the ability to design and scaffold a cloud-native application project for Choreo using the powerful Ballerina programming language directly from within the VS Code IDE. The extension makes it easier for you to quickly get started with Choreo by generating project structures and defining service interfaces.

Another significant enhancement is the ability to log in to the Choreo platform via VS Code and manage the existing projects and components. The Choreo extension allows you to clone existing projects, edit the code in them, and then, push the changes to the Choreo platform directly from VS Code. This means that now, you can view and edit all your projects, services, APIs, and integrations without leaving the code editor. This streamlined workflow makes it easier than ever for you to collaborate with other developers to manage code changes.

Furthermore, the extension enables you to create various types of components including RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, webhooks, or scheduled apps. With the extension, you can create these new components, implement the rnecessary logic, and deploy them to Choreo easily from within the VS Code IDE itself.

We hope you find these new features useful and convenient. If you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to raise issues in the [`chore-vscode`](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-vscode) GitHub repository.
